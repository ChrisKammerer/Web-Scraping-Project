# Web-Scraping-Project
Here I have the java files of my project in it's current state. As of now, it accesses Ebay and lists all the items from a search term given to the console. 
It then displays these search results in a text document with their name, price, and url. The list is sorted by price from low to high. I would like to 
process the information more including product reviews, price ranges, and best value. I've spent a lot of time reading guides on web scraping and reading
the documentation and other implementations of the HtmlUnit library. This is the particular library I chose to use to complete this project.
